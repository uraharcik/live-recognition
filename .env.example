# API Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Must use HTTPS because the app requires camera access (only works over HTTPS)
# Replace with the IP address of the PC running Docker backend
#
# To find the IP address of the Docker host PC:
# - On Windows: Open CMD and run: ipconfig (look for IPv4 Address)
# - On Mac: Open Terminal and run: ifconfig | grep "inet " (look for the local network IP like 192.168.x.x)
# - On Linux: Open Terminal and run: ip addr show (look for the local network IP)
#
# Example: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://192.168.1.100:8000/api/v1
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://192.168.1.100:8000/api/v1

# API Key for authentication
# Replace with your actual API key provided by the backend service
VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
